this is a great app for coupons .

you can load your own photos or custom designs and the scanner or single shot option will pop up a modal if the image in your collection is the same.

As far as labeling a photo goes if you want to see a label to describe the photo, that is really based on the photos you have already being labeled properly.

To be successful you would want to have the algorithm be based on hundreds of millions of photos with different tags. Essentially you would want access to google's collection of alt tags to be super accurate.

But if done by yourself you would want to custom label all the photos one by one if you wanted to have an edge over big data...

-but that is simply my initial assessment of this software
